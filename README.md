# Repo of Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo aims to assist on the track of the study of algorithms and data structures in PHP.
The idea here is use as minimum as possible of built-in methods to implement algorithms and data structures. 
First iteration will always be the most rudimentar form of the algorithm or data structure. Using hard coded entries and without analasys of the algorithm.

## Algorithms 
1. **Insertion sort**: this algorithm builds the ordered sequence one element at time.
